<p>This document is the API specification of main public concepts involved in the interactions of the different Keyple
    components.</p>
<p>The interfaces defined in this API allow to type the objects exchanged by the different Keyple components without
    assigning methods to them.<br/>
    They allow data to pass from one module to another via the application layer, which does not need to know the
    content of the objects being exchanged.</p>
